# hacking-codehs
A *VERY* simple guide on how to exploit CodeHS terminal with Python 

#### Note: Make your programs in codehs.com/sandbox/{user}/{program}, save them, and run them in codehs.com/sandbox/{user}/{program}/run so you don't into storage problems

## Getting started
You will start by making a simple program that gives you access to the kernel using Bash. Type this into your code editor.

```
import os

os.system('bash')
```

As you can see it is not at all comlplicated, as it only takes two lines of code without spaces. It'll only get easier from here!

### Play around a bit

Do some simple bash programs to get used to the enviorment. For example:

#### df -H
![dfh](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f2c5ec3e-e4b7-4d05-8d5b-edfe1460d541)
#### fdisk -l
